- vte3: needed to display sptlrx
- cava
- swaylock effects
- eza (better ls, optional)
- bat (better cat, optional)
- zsh-autosuggestion
- zsh-syntax-highlighting

- GTK-theme:  Catppuccin

### Usage
the following commands assume you have placed the files their correct location

ags -c ~/.config/ags/config.js --init 
npm install
cp keys.template.js keys.js
#edit keys.js to your needs
```
